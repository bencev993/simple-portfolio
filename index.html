            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
                Iâ€™m a passionate and dedicated designer with a keen eye for detail and a love for creating visually stunning and user-friendly designs. With a background in graphic and web design, I strive to bring innovative ideas to life through my work. My goal is to deliver designs that not only look great but also provide a seamless user experience.

                        <p>
                            I began my professional journey in 2014 after graduating with a degree in Graphic Design. During this period, I worked with different companies, where I honed my skills in branding, print design, and digital illustration. My time here allowed me to develop a solid foundation in design principles and to work on a variety of projects that ranged from logo creation to marketing materials.

                        <p>
                            In 2018, I joined a different company, where I expanded my expertise to include web and UI/UX design. This role provided me with the opportunity to work on large-scale projects and collaborate with cross-functional teams. I led the redesign of several high-profile websites and mobile apps, ensuring they were both aesthetically pleasing and highly functional. My work during this time received several industry recognitions, and I was able to build a strong portfolio that showcased my versatility and creativity.

                            Since 2022, I have been working as a Senior Designer at Google and freelancing for various clients. In this role, I focus on creating cutting-edge designs that push the boundaries of traditional design. I am constantly exploring new tools and techniques to stay ahead in the fast-paced world of design. My recent projects include designing interactive web experiences, developing brand identities, and mentoring junior designers. I am passionate about continuing to grow as a designer and helping brands tell their stories through innovative and impactful design.
